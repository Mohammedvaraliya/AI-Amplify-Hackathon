# AI Amplify Hackathon

This repository contains the solutions to three problem statements completed during the hackathon. Each problem statement is categorized based on its difficulty level: Easy, Moderate, and Hard.

## Problem Statements

### Easy Problem Statement: Autocorrect Suggestions

**Problem Statement Description:**
The task was to develop an AI system capable of providing autocorrect suggestions for English words. The system should recognize misspelled words and suggest the correct spelling. It should handle a wide range of words and common spelling mistakes.

**Solution:**
...

**Reference:**
The [GeeksforGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/autocorrector-feature-using-nlp-in-python/) on autocorrect features using NLP in Python was used as a basis for the implementation.

### Moderate Problem Statement: LinkedIn Sentiment Analysis

**Problem Statement Description:**
The task involved developing an AI system capable of performing sentiment analysis on the posts and comments of any given LinkedIn page or post. The system should categorize the text as positive, negative, or neutral and provide an overall sentiment distribution.

**Solution:**
...

**Reference:**
The [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12421.pdf) on sentiment analysis was used as a reference to guide the implementation.

### Hard Problem Statement: Gratitude Assistant using ChatGPT 4

**Problem Statement Description:**
The task was to train a ChatGPT model to function as a Gratitude Assistant. The model should generate thoughtful, compassionate, and personalized responses that express gratitude based on the user's input. The model should understand the context of the conversation and generate appropriate gratitude responses.

**Solution:**
For this problem statement, the OpenAI ChatGPT 3.5 model was utilized. The model was trained to generate gratitude responses that are contextually accurate, convey genuine gratitude, and are personalized to the user's input.
